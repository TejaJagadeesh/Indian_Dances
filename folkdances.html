                                Folk dances and plays in India retain significance in rural areas as the expression of the daily work and rituals of village communities.
                                Sanskrit literature of medieval times describes several forms of group dances such as Hallisaka, Rasaka, Dand Rasaka and Charchari. 
                                The Natya Shastra includes group dances of women as a preliminary dance performed in prelude to a drama.<br>
                                India has numerous folk dances. Every state has its own folk dance forms like <a href="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\project\bihu.html" >Bihu</a> and Bagurumba in Assam,

                                likewise for each state and smaller regions in it.Lavani, and Lezim, and Koli dance is most popular dance in Maharashtra.We are discussing some of them in this project.Tribal Dances in India are inspired by the tribal folklore. Each ethnic group has its own distinct combination
                                of myths, legends, tales, proverbs, riddles, ballads, folk songs, folk dance, and folk music.
                                The dancers do not necessarily fall rigidly into the category of "tribal". However, these forms of dance closely depict their life, social relationships, work and religious affiliations.
                                They represent the rich culture and customs of their native lands through intricate movements of their bodies. A wide variation can be observed in the intensity of these dances. 
                                Some involve very slight movement with a groovier edge to it, while others involve elevated and vigorous involvement of limbs.
                                These dances are composed mostly on locally made instruments. Percussion instruments feature in most of these dances.

                        Music is produced through indigenous instruments. Music too has its own diversity in these tribal dances with the aesthetics ranging from mild and soothing to strong and weighted rhythms.
                        A few of them also have songs, either sung by themselves or by onlookers. The costumes vary from traditional saris of a particular pattern to skirts and blouses with mirror work for women
                        and corresponding dhotis and upper-wear for men. They celebrate contemporary events, victories and are often performed as a mode of appeasing the tribal deities.
                        A lot of the dance styles depend upon the regional positioning of the ethnic group. Factors as small as east or west of a river result in a change of dance form even though the over-reaching look of it may seem the same. The religious affiliation affects the content of the songs and hence the actions in a dance sequence. Another major factor affecting their content are the festivals, mostly harvest.
                        For example, the ethnic groups from the plain land rabhas from the hilly forested areas of Assam make use of baroyat (plate-like instrument), handa (a type of sword), boushi (adze-like instrument), boumshi (bamboo flute), sum (heavy wooden instrument), dhansi. kalbansi, kalhurang, chingbakak. Traditionally, their dances are called basili. Through their dance, they express their labours, rejoicings and sorrows. 
                        Handur Basu their pseudo-war dance expresses their strength and solidarity. <br>
                        Indian folk dances,which typically consist of a few simple steps, are performed throughout the world to celebrate a new season, childbirth, weddings, festivals, and other social occasions. In some Indian folk dances, men and women perform separately; in others, they dance together. On most occasions, the dancers will sing accompanied by musicians. Most folk dances have intricately-designed costumes.
                        Although a number of structured, ancient folk and tribal dances exist, many others are evolving.</p>
