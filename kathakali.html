                Kathakali (Malayalam: കഥകളി) is a major form of classical Indian dance. It is a "story play" genre of art, 
                but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up and costumes of the traditional male actor-dancers. 
                It is native to the Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of Kerala and is almost entirely practiced and appreciated by Malayali people.
                Kathakali is one of the eight classical dances of India
                Hanuman in Kathakali (FACT Jayadeva Varma)
                Kathakali's roots are unclear. The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 17th century, but its roots are in the temple and
                folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut) southwestern Indian peninsula), which are traceable to at
                least the 1st millennium CE.A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and
                facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.) 
                Kathakali also differs in that the structure and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike other classical Indian dances which primarily
                developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools.[citation needed]
                The traditional themes of the Kathakali are folk stories, religious legends and spiritual ideas from the Hindu epics and the Puranas.The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in 
                Sanskritised Malayalam.Krishnanattam is dance-drama art form about the life and activities of Hindu god Krishna, that developed under 
                the sponsorship of Sri Manavedan Raja, the ruler of Calicut (1585-1658 AD). The traditional legend states that Kottarakkara Thampuran (also known as Vira Kerala Varma) requested the services of a Krishnanattam troupe, but his request was denied.
                So Kottarakkara Thampuran created another art form based on Krishnanattam, called it Ramanattam because the early plays were based on the Hindu epic Ramayana, which over time diversified beyond Ramayana and became popular as 'Kathakali'.
