                Sattriya (Assamese: সত্ৰীয়া), or Sattriya Nritya, is a major Indian classical dance. This dance was initially created as 
                part of Bhaona which are performances of Ankiya Nat, one-act plays, originally created by Sankardev, the 15th-16th century polymath from Assam. 
                These dances are part of the living traditions today of Sattras, which are communities of live-in devotees belonging to the Ekasarana dharma, the religion established by Sankardev.
                The themes played are related to Lord Krishna, sometimes other Vishnu avatars such as Rama and Sita  and stories from the epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana) are also referred to. 
                The philosophic religion of Mahapurush Srimanta Sankaradeva was based on Vedanta, Bhagavadgītā and the Bhāgavata Purāna, so there is no presence of Radha in Sattriya dance presentations.[citation needed]
                On November 15 in the year 2000, the Sangeet Natak Akademi of India recognized Sattriya as one of the eight classical dances of India. Modern Sattriya explores many themes and plays, and its performances are staged worldwide.
                Sattriya is a classical dance of India, tracing its roots to ancient drama and music texts of India, particularly Bharata Muni's Nātya Śāstra.
                Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.The most studied version of the Nātya Śāstra text consists of about 6000 verses structured
                into 36 chapters.The text describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures  all of which are part of Indian classical dances.
                Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text,are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues, and the essence of scriptures.
                The history of dance arts in Assam goes back to antiquity, as evidenced by copper plate inscriptions and sculpture relating to Shaivism and Shaktism traditions.
                Singing and musical traditions, similarly, have been traced to Assamese chorus singing tradition for the Hindu epics: the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
